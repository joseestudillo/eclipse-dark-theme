# Eclipse Dark Theme

Improvements for the default Eclipse dark theme.

It has only been tested on a Mac.

# Quick installation

Clone the project into your work space. Guessing that the project have been cloned in to the directory `eclipse` type the following:

```bash
cd eclipse
cp -R .metadata ../
```

# Use

Overwrite the `.metadata` folder in your workspace. Notice that this will completely overwrite any existing configuration.

# Known Issues

The scroll bars still white. This can be only seen if a mouse is used.
